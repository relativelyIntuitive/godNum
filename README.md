"# godNum" 

This is a simple Flask site that I created to interact with a pair of original JavaScript algorithms that I created for experimenting with the relationship between factors and dividends.

The JS script holding the algorithms is executed by the browser client-side, so there are some limitations as to the size of the parameters entered depending on the user's hardware. Some basic maximums are explained on each calculator.

Start with low limits and rais them gradually! This is the intended experience, as the patterns of the relationship are best experienced starting from its inception at zero.

Have fun!
